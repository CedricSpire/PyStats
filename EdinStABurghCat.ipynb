The burgesses of Cupar claimed that the guild brothers of Cupar had been the sole possessors of this right for 'a long period of time', but refused to offer a counter-suit against the bishop's caution 'for the reason that they had neither day nor place up to this point competent for submitting their evidence, or for otherwise opposing the foresaid caution'. The king and parliament found in favour of St Andrews, and ordered the rights to be restored to them and injuries and damages to be sought by them on a day and place assigned to them before the king's justiciar. Anyone in Cupar who violated this prohibition was to be fined £100 sterling, and sureties were to be taken from the four Cupar burgesses present to set a time and date under penalty for the execution of justice to be carried out. \\n\\n\\n\\nLatin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB65/23/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n7 February 1369-1370\\n\\nDirection of David II to William Dischington to investigate merchandise dispute between St Andrews and Cupar \\n\\n\\n\\n1 document\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid II orders William Dischington 'knight our justiciar on the North side of the water of Forth' (Willelmo de Dyssyntone militi Justiciaro nostro ex parte boreali aque de Forth) to investigate complaint of the Bishop of St Andrews [William de Landels] that the burgesses of Cupar, contrary to previous prohibition, are still interfering with the rights of St Andrews to merchandise within Cupar.

To this course the Pope and chapter foresaid with the said Master General agreed and interponed their authority; whereupon with consent of James, King of Scots and John, Duke of Albany governor of the realm the said friar John Adamson (Adamsoun) after his return from the said chapter general, in the provincial chapter held at Edinburgh on the Feast of St Michael the Archangel in the year 1519 with consent also of Friar Robert Lyle (Lile), prior of Perth, friar John Spens prior of Glasgow, Friar John Greerson (Greirsoun), prior of St Andrews and friar Stephen Muir (Mure) vicar of Edinburgh united and incorporated and hereby unite and incorporate the said place of Cupar namely the church and house foresaid with other buildings, gardens, walls and pertinents lying between the water of Eden on the east and the east gate of the burgh of Cupar on the west the castle hill on the north and the tenements of the deceased Thomas Steel (Steill) on the south and these four acres of arable land called St Katharine's Haugh (St Katherinis Hauch) lying over against the said place on the east side of the water of Eden between the said water on the west and north, the lands of Little Tarvit (Tarvat) commonly called Hippehill (?) on the east and the common way leading from the bridge of the said burgh built over the Eden towards Ballas (?) and the church of St Michael on the south and that annualrent of £5 Scots upliftable from the whole lands of Rathillet (Rathuliet)  granted to the said place of Cupar by the deceased Duncan Earl of Fife with all other lands, annualrents, alms, possessions, rights and emoluments as well within as without the burgh of Cupar belonging to the said place, and transferring the friars there to the said place of St Andrews, and whereas the body of the glorious confessor of God the blessed Monan lies in the church of Inuerry they unite and incorporate the said house of St Monans of Inuerry (?) to the said house or place of St Andrews with the provision that two friars priests of honourable age pure in morals and chastity shall remain there to serve God and the blessed Monan his confessor patron of the said church by day and night and they are to have and receive for the maintenance of themsleves and the fabrics of the said church and house all the annualrents, lands, alms, offerings and emoluments which the friars of the said place were accustomed to receive excepting only 20 merks of annualrent which the deceased Robert, Duke of Albany, Earl of Fife (Fiffe) and Monteith gave to two chaplains serving God in the said church of Inuerry (?) upliftable from his whole lands of Northburns (Northbernis) now called the King's (Kingis) Burns (Bernis) which 20 merks the friars of the said place were accustomed to uplift from the customs of the burgh of Cupar and which 20 merks the said friar John Adamson (Adamsoun) with consent foresaid unites and incorporates to the said place of St Andrews to be applied for support of the students of the said order.

Deed narrating a contract between the said David on the one part, and John Brown, his brother german and heir apparent, on the other.  Contract in the form of an Instrument under the hands of Robert Lawson and Robert Reid, notaries public, dated at St Andrews, 5 September 1520.\\n\\n\\n\\nContract for the foundation of two chaplainries for the benefit of the souls of the said David and John, those of their heirs, parents, ancestors, and all the faithful departed, and for the welfare of the said John.  One supported from the tenement or land called Cairns (Kernisland, Cairnsmill) lying in St Andrews on the south side of South Street, between the tenement of Alexander Scott, one of the chaplains at the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the parish church of St Andrews, in the west, and the tenement of the chaplain of the altar of St Andrew in the said parish church, in the east.  The other supported from the tenement of the said David Brown, lying in Edinburgh in the vennel called Niddry (Nudreis) Wynd on the west side thereof, built by the said David.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe said David died before fulfilment of the said contract.  In order that the said John and his heirs, whom failing the nearest in name and blood to the said David, may be patrons of the said chaplainries, the foresaid executors - with the consent of Gavin [Dunbar] the Bishop of Aberdeen, superior of the foresaid testament - found and erect the two chaplainries in terms of the desire of the said David, hereby to the glory of the Trinity and the Virgin Mary begetter of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and all saints, and for the increase of divine worship, and for the welfare of the souls foresaid.  They appoint Sir Alexander Brown, one of the executors nominated by the said David and John, to be chaplain of one of the chaplainries, and George Brown, son of John  Brown younger citizen of Brechin and grandson of the foresaid John Brown elder, to be chaplain of the other chaplainry; and because the said George is not of lawful age that he might exercise priestly office, the executors authorise him to uplift the rents and profits of his chaplainry, the duties being performed by someone nominated by him until he reaches the age of 25 after which, he is to serve at the altar himself.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe chaplainries are to receive the rents of the foresaid properties in equal proportions. The chaplains are to officiate; one in the parish church of St Andrews in the aisle of the Blessed Bartholomew where the said David is buried, the other in the parish church of Arbroath (Abyrbrothok) [Angus], where lie the bones of the parents and progenitors of the said David and John, at the altar of St Michael.  They are to reside at the respective churches, but a month's absence or the taking of a concubine will disqualify them from continuing.  In the event of the patrons failing to do their duty, the provost of St Andrews is ultimately responsible for the supply of chaplains.\\n\\n\\n\\nWitnesses: David Learmonth (Lermonth) of Clatto, Mr. James Wishart (Weschert) of Pittanow?

Specifically issued against the following residents of St Andrews pretending to have interest and cause underwritten: William Foggie (Fogo); James Brog; Thomas Christie (Criste); John Barber?

The plaintiff requested that the tenants, occupiers and other persons indebted in payment of the fruits, duties, annualrents, profits and emoliments of the said lands, buildings and churches make full payment of the same, conforming to their own infeftment.  Concerning the charge brought against those specifically mentioned, all other tenants etc. indebted, and all those pretending to have entry thereto, the Council requested that they appear before the Lords of Council at a certain date now passed to hear and sign the letters given and decreed in the four forms - the said persons to be warded in Blackness Castle in event of disobedience.  The Council charged said persons to answer and fulfil obligations to the burgh - or burgh procurators and no other - of the said lands, buildings, churches, yards, acres, annualrents, duties etc since 1567, and similarly in years to come - failing which, they are to have reasonable cause.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterested parties were represented by procurators as follows: the Provost etc. of St Andrews, by Mr Richard Strange (Strang); Robert Methven (Methwen) and James Martin (Martyn), two patrons of the said chaplainries in St Andrews, by Mr William Scott (Scot) and Alexander King; George lord Seton and John Seton of Charleston?

They further endorsed the warding in Blackness in event of disobedience, and charged those indebted as outlined above and those pretending entry to comply with the terms stated.  Exceptions being properties in Crown patronage, in lay patronage, altarages and benefices of living men, others that are in their presentation, and those properties formerly pertaining to the Blackfriars but which the said Lord Seton and his brother, John, are heritably infeft.  This decree was dated at Edinburgh, 17 April 1567 \\n\\n\\n\\nAll the said persons were lawfully summoned to appear before the said Lords, by a date long past - to hear and sign the letters directed upon them in the manner stated or else to have reasonable cause as to why they could not meet the said requirements - and none of them appeared, nor did they appear to offer any reasonable cause as to why not.
